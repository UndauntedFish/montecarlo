# montecarlo

montecarlo is a command-line Java program that performs a Monte-Carlo simulation on trading systems. It does this by drawing a user-specified large number of trades from the trading system's probability distribution for a large number of trials (also user-specified).

The purpose of doing this is to stress test a trading system by seeing how it may play out over the course of millions of different scenarios.
